# Background
Wake County provides [open data](https://data-wake.opendata.arcgis.com/) for the public to analyze, including
data on restaurant inspections. 
I've been meaning to use an open dataset for a while, and decided to start by inventing a prediction problem that would leverage
their open data about restaurants and restaurant inspections in Wake County.

# Scenario
At the end of 2018, the Wake County health department decides to implement a mailing campaign to increase
awareness of food handling best practices, with the goal of decreasing the number of "at-risk" restaurants (those
receiving an inspection score < 93). 

Wake County can only send 500 mailers, and wants to use data science to successfully target as many "at-risk"
restaurants in advance of their inspection as possible.

# Dataset
We have 3 tables to work with, courtesy of Wake County Open Data:
* [Restaurants](https://data-wake.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/restaurants-in-wake-county)
<br>`Restaurants` gives details on each restaurant location, such as `NAME`, `PHONENUMBER`, and `RESTAURANTOPENDATE`.
* [Inspections](https://data-wake.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/food-inspections)
<br>`Inspections` gives details on each restaurant inspection. Most restaurants have multiple entries in `inspections`,
including information like `INSPECTDATE`, `INSPECTOR`, and `SCORE`.
* [Violations](https://data-wake.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/food-inspection-violations)
<br>`Violations` details the violations detected in each restaurant inspection. Most inspections have multiple entries
in `violations`, including information like `CATEGORY`, `SEVERITY`, and `COMMENTS`.

<br>All datasets were pulled on 7/3/19.

## Cleaning
Our first task is inspecting the datasets and tidying them up a bit.
```python
rest = pd.read_csv('./data/Restaurants_in_Wake_County.csv', index_col=['OBJECTID'],
                  parse_dates=['RESTAURANTOPENDATE'], infer_datetime_format=True)

insp = pd.read_csv('./data/Food_Inspections.csv', index_col=['OBJECTID'],
                  parse_dates=['DATE_'], infer_datetime_format=True)

viol = pd.read_csv('./data/Food_Inspection_Violations.csv',
                  parse_dates=['INSPECTDATE'], infer_datetime_format=True, low_memory=False)
```

Looking at `restaurants`:

|HSISID|NAME|CITY|POSTALCODE|PHONENUMBER|RESTAURANTOPENDATE|FACILITYTYPE|PERMITID|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|2001|4092030273|RARE EARTH FARMS (WCID #512)|RALEIGH|27606|(919) 349-6080|2015-01-16 00:00:00+00:00|Mobile Food Units|18359|
|2002|4092015000|GRACE Christian School Kitchen|RALEIGH|27606|(919) 783-6618|2007-11-06 00:00:00+00:00|Restaurant|3377|

The `CITY` field is not standardized - we'll fix it by turning all lowercase, and replacing hyphens with a space.
```python 
rest['CITY'] = rest['CITY'].str.lower().str.replace('-', ' ')
```

For simplicity, we'll lump any `CITY` that contains less than 10 restaurants into an `other` category.
Rows with missing `CITY` will also be lumped into `other`.
```python 
rest.loc[rest['CITY'].isin(rest['CITY'].value_counts()[rest['CITY'].value_counts()<10].index),
        'CITY'] = 'other'
rest['CITY'].fillna('other', inplace=True)
```

`POSTALCODE` isn't standardized either - abbreviate to 5 digit format and treat as integer.
```python
rest['POSTALCODE'] = rest['POSTALCODE'].apply(lambda st:int(st[:5]))
```

`NAME` is generally messy, as most freeform text fields are - in an effort to standardize,
we'll remove odd characters and lowercase.
```python
from re import findall
rest['NAME'] = rest['NAME'].str.lower().str.replace('`', "'").apply(lambda x:' '.join(findall(r"([a-z'-]+)(?=\s|$)", x)))
```

Looking at `inspections`:

|OBJECTID|HSISID|SCORE|INSPECTDATE|DESCRIPTION|TYPE|INSPECTOR|PERMITID|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|1001|4092015443|96.0|2015-03-24 00:00:00+00:00|NaN|Inspection|Caroline Suggs|4768|
|1002|4092015443|94.0|2015-09-25 00:00:00+00:00|Follow-Up: 10/05/2015|Inspection|Jennifer Edwards|4768|

Interestingly, only about 97% of the rows in `inspections` can be connected to `restaurants`, and we
need all the data for modeling, so we'll only retain those that can be linked back to the other tables.
```python
insp = insp[insp['HSISID'].isin(rest['HSISID'])]
```

We're not going to use `violations` beyond a measure of how many violations each inspection found, so the 
majority of the columns are irrelevant. However, we will perform the same filter as we used on `inspections`, so that
all `violations` can be connected to `restaurants`, using `inspections` as a crosswalk.
```python
viol = viol.drop('HSISID', axis=1).join(insp.set_index('PERMITID')['HSISID'].drop_duplicates(),
         on='PERMITID', how='inner')
```

## Exploration
Wake County is growing in population, and new restaurants are being opened each month. This means that the Wake County health department
is performing more inspections each month.

Interestingly, we see that each inspection is detecting fewer inspections over time - whether this is due to an actual improvement in
restaurant cleanliness or change in reporting is open to debate.
![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/restaurants/violations_by_month.jpg)
There is no trend in average inspection `SCORE` over time, leading me to think that the change in violations is reporting drift.

# Making predictions
Imagine it's Christmas break, end of 2018, and we've scheduled restaurant inspections for the first 6 months of 2019. 
In hopes of increasing the scores of at-risk restaurants, we'd like to implement a mailing campaign, targeted at restaurants 
who we expect to receive a low `SCORE`, giving them information about common violations and advice for proper procedures. 
Hopefully, this will elicit improvements before our inspector visits, and the restaurant will receive a higher inspection `SCORE`.

For the purpose of this exercise, we define an "at-risk" restaurant as one we expect to receive a `SCORE`<93.

## Approach
We have data from September 2012 through the end of July 2019. We're pretending it's the end of 2019 right now, so January through July 2019
will happen in the "future" and should be ignored during our entire modeling process. They're the inspections we want to target with the mailing campaign!

The majority of the data before 2019 we'll use to train our models, leaving a
test set of 6 months set aside to see how models would perform out-of-sample. All `inspections` with an `INSPECTDATE` prior to 
2018-07-01 will be used for training, and the remainder of 2018 will be our test set.

At the very end, we'll see how our best model would have performed if we actually mailed to the restaurants in the first 6 months of 2019.

## Feature engineering
For both the train and test sets, we need inputs from what we know about each restaurant.

Features will include:
* the number of days the restaurant has been open (`TIMEOPEN`, integer)
* the number of days since the restaurant was last inspected (`TIMESINCE`, integer)
* the number of other restaurants (unique HSISIDs) with the same name (`CHAINCOUNT`, integer)
* the number of inspections for the restaurant (`INSPCOUNT`, integer)
* whether the restaurant has ever needed a re-inspection (`WASREINSP`, binary)
* the average number of violations per inspection for that restaurant (`AVGVIOL`, float)

<br>

Just for fun and in case of some seasonality to inspections, we'll throw in cyclical features for month:
* `SINMONTH` (float)
* `COSMONTH` (float)

<br>

Including preexisting features:
* `FACILITYTYPE` (categorical and will be converted to dummy variables)
* `CITY` (categorical and will be converted to dummy variables)
* `POSTALCODE` (integer, due to the fact that zipcodes that are close in number tend to be geographically similar as well)
* `AREACODE` (categorical, will be extracted from the existing `PHONE NUMBER` field

<br>

Wrapping in a few details on the restaurant's most recent inspection, prior to that in question:
* the type of the restaurant's most recent inspection (`TYPE_previous`, categorical to dummy)
* the inspector who completed the most recent inspection (`INSPECTOR_previous`, categorical to dummy)
* the previous inspection score (`SCORE_previous`, float)

<br>

For kicks, we will also use NLP to parse the text in the restaurant's `NAME`, in hopes of extracting some insight into the cuisine type 
or food style (ie. `buffet` might indicate a higher chance of failing inspection). I've arbitrarily decided to choose the top 
40 words from restaurant `NAME`, using most frequent words (most frequent in the training set).

For brevity the entirety of the ```engineer_features()``` function has been omitted, but is available in my Example Projects git [repository](https://github.com/p-mckenzie/example-projects).
Here, we'll simply apply it to the different time windows to create our 3 datasets (`X` for training, `test` for testing, and `validation`
to see how our model would've done targeting customers in the first half of 2019).
```python
validation_date = '2019-01-01'
test_date = '2018-07-01'

X = engineer_features(insp[insp['INSPECTDATE']<test_date], rest)

validation = engineer_features(insp, rest)
validation = validation[validation['INSPECTDATE']>=validation_date]

test = engineer_features(insp[insp['INSPECTDATE']<validation_date], rest)
test = test[test['INSPECTDATE']>=test_date]
```

## Modeling
We'll use cross-validation on the `X` dataset with known scores, to determine optimal model parameters. The reserved `test` set 
will be used to choose the best model, hopefully controlling for over-fitting. Finally, we will see how we would perform on the `validation` set, had we actually 
implemented the model-building process to identify the 500 most "at-risk" restaurants in the first half of 2019.

### Balance classes
The current training set is about 10% "at-risk", 90% not "at-risk". To help our models differentiate the two and better identify the most "at-risk", 
we'll adjust the distribution in training by over-sampling our "at-risk" restaurants and mildly under-sampling our not "at-risk".

```python
oversample = 2 # the number of times to include each positive target row
ratio = .3 # the goal target distribution (% of positive class)

X_neg = X[X['SCORE']<93]
X_pos = X[X['SCORE']>=93]

X = X_pos.sample(int(oversample*len(X_pos)), replace=True).append(
    X_neg.sample(int((1/ratio-1)*oversample*len(X_pos)), replace=True))
```
### Separate input from output
For train, test, and validation we need to separate the target from the input variables.

```python
y = (X['SCORE']<93).astype(int)
X = X.drop(['SCORE', 'INSPECTDATE'], axis=1)

# also separate test, validation into X, and y
y_test = (test['SCORE']<93).astype(int)
X_test = test.drop(['SCORE', 'INSPECTDATE'], axis=1)

y_val = (validation['SCORE']<93).astype(int)
X_val = validation.drop(['SCORE', 'INSPECTDATE'], axis=1)
```
### Make/evaluate a random predictions
We'll use AUC as our metric of choice for evaluating the model in-sample and out-of-sample.
A random prediction should get an AUC of 0.5, and we find that to be true.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score

print("Train AUC:", roc_auc_score(y, np.random.choice([0,1], size=len(y))))
print("Mailing accuracy:", y_test.loc[np.random.choice(y_test.index, size=500)].mean())
```
> Train AUC: 0.5007870363712852<br>
> Mailing accuracy: 0.1

As expected, a random guess produces AUC around 0.5, and only 10% of our mailers, had we randomly chosen 500 inspections in our test set 
to contact, would have successfully reached an "at-risk" restaurant.

### GridSearch for decision tree
Using 3-fold cross validation on the train set, we'll evaluate a set of parameters to build a decision tree model.
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=1)
tree_grid = GridSearchCV(tree, param_grid={'max_depth':[3,5,7,12],
                                     'max_features':[.5,.8,1.]},
                   scoring='roc_auc', cv=3, n_jobs=-1, 
                         verbose=1, return_train_score=True)
tree_grid.fit(X, y)

tree = tree_grid.best_estimator_

print("Train AUC:", roc_auc_score(y, tree.predict(X)))
print("Test AUC:", roc_auc_score(y_test, tree.predict(X_test)))

tree_mailing_acc = y_test.loc[pd.Series(tree.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1], index=X_test.index).nlargest(500).index].mean()
print("Mailing accuracy:", tree_mailing_acc)
print("Mailing lift:", round(tree_mailing_acc/y_test.mean(), 2))
```
> Train AUC: 0.8119711392149564<br>
> Test AUC: 0.7180557838785686<br>
> Mailing accuracy: 0.344<br>
> Mailing lift: 3.31

We get about a 3x improvement on our mailing performance (over a random guess) by simply using a decision tree - however, the model
is over-fit, judging by the drop-off between train and test AUC, and may not generalize well.

### GridSearch for bagging
In hopes of combatting overfitting we'll try bagging, which will allow us to build multiple decision trees on different "views" of the 
same data. We'll still use 3-fold cross validation to test different parameters.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier

bags = BaggingClassifier(random_state=1, base_estimator=DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=6))
bags_grid = GridSearchCV(bags, param_grid={'n_estimators':[20,120,220],
                                     'max_samples':[.1,.3,.5]},
                   scoring='roc_auc', cv=3, n_jobs=-1, 
                         verbose=1, return_train_score=True)
bags_grid.fit(X, y)

bags = bags_grid.best_estimator_

print("Train AUC:", roc_auc_score(y, bags.predict(X)))
print("Test AUC:", roc_auc_score(y_test, bags.predict(X_test)))

bags_mailing_acc = y_test.loc[pd.Series(bags.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1], index=X_test.index).nlargest(500).index].mean()
print("Mailing accuracy:", bags_mailing_acc)
print("Mailing lift:", round(bags_mailing_acc/y_test.mean(), 2))
```
> Train AUC: 0.76907791565791<br>
> Test AUC: 0.7674995890185763<br>
> Mailing accuracy: 0.418<br>
> Mailing lift: 4.02

This model performs much better overall, with a tiny drop-off between train and test AUC, and superior performance on the mailing
compared to the single decision tree.

### GridSearch for boosting
For completeness, we'll try a few more models in hopes of better results - first, boosting, which builds trees on the errors of the
previous models, rather than sampling rows like bagging.
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier

boost = GradientBoostingClassifier(random_state=1, init=DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=6))
boost_grid = GridSearchCV(bags, param_grid={'n_estimators':[20,120,220],
                                            'max_features':[.3,.5,.8]},
                   scoring='roc_auc', cv=3, n_jobs=-1, 
                         verbose=1, return_train_score=True)
boost_grid.fit(X, y)

boost = boost_grid.best_estimator_

print("Train AUC:", roc_auc_score(y, boost.predict(X)))
print("Test AUC:", roc_auc_score(y_test, boost.predict(X_test)))

boost_mailing_acc = y_test.loc[pd.Series(boost.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1], index=X_test.index).nlargest(500).index].mean()
print("Mailing accuracy:", boost_mailing_acc)
print("Mailing lift:", round(boost_mailing_acc/y_test.mean(), 2))
```
> Train AUC: 0.6919756499060097<br>
> Test AUC: 0.6839333662118472<br>
> Mailing accuracy: 0.42<br>
> Mailing lift: 4.04

A solid model, but much lower AUC, both in-sample and out-of-sample.

### GridSearch for random forest
Lastly, we'll try a random forest, which samples both features (like boosting) and rows (like bagging).
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

rf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1, max_depth=6)
rf_grid = GridSearchCV(bags, param_grid={'n_estimators':[20,120],
                                     'max_samples':[.3,.5,.7],
                                     'max_features':[.3,.4,.5]},
                   scoring='roc_auc', cv=3, n_jobs=-1, 
                         verbose=1, return_train_score=True)
rf_grid.fit(X, y)

rf = rf_grid.best_estimator_

print("Train AUC:", roc_auc_score(y, rf.predict(X)))
print("Test AUC:", roc_auc_score(y_test, rf.predict(X_test)))

rf_mailing_acc = y_test.loc[pd.Series(rf.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1], index=X_test.index).nlargest(500).index].mean()
print("Mailing accuracy:", rf_mailing_acc)
print("Mailing lift:", round(rf_mailing_acc/y_test.mean(), 2))
```
> Train AUC: 0.6950166305726755<br>
> Test AUC: 0.6854402980985259<br>
> Mailing accuracy: 0.426<br>
> Mailing lift: 4.1

Comparable to boosting alone, and still not as good as bagging.

## Simulating the mailer
We selected our bagging model as the winner during the modeling process. Now, let's use it to predict the inspections in the first half of 2019,
and "see the future" to see how we would've done.
```python
y_val.mean()
```
> 0.0989065606361829

Remember, if we randomly mailed to restaurants about to be inspected we could expect only 9% of the recipients to be designated "at-risk".

```python
y_val.loc[pd.Series(bags.predict_proba(X_val)[:,1], index=X_val.index).nlargest(500).index].mean()
```
> 0.412

However, if we used the bagging model that won during modeling, we would've successfully contacted 41% "at-risk" restaurants!
