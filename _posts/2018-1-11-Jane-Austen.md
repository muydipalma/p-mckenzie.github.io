This post will detail the exploration of three novels by Jane Austen: 
**Emma**, **Pride and Prejudice**, **Sense and Sensibility**. 

I used Python, relying primarily on the pandas, re, and nltk libraries. 
The visualizations were generated using the Bokeh library.

The [code](https://github.com/p-mckenzie/example-projects) can be applied to any combination of books, with a few modifications.

# Data setup
Raw text files for the novels were acquired courtesy of [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/), 
a website that hosts books not protected by U.S. copyright law, usually due to copyright expiration.

I downloaded the Plain Text UTF-8 options for each book:
1. [Emma](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/158)
2. [Pride and Prejudice](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42671)
3. [Sense and Sensibility](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21839)

<br>

Project Gutenberg adds extra license and disclaimer information before and after the actual text of each novel, 
so it was necessary to split the text files on the delimiters, such as the title/author and 'the end'.
```python
with open('Sense and Sensibility.txt', 'r') as myfile:
    sas_data = myfile.read().split('SENSE AND SENSIBILITY\n\nby Jane Austen\n\n(1811)')[1].split('THE END')[0].strip()

with open('Emma.txt', 'r') as myfile:
    emma_data = myfile.read().split('EMMA\n\nBy Jane Austen')[1].split('FINIS')[0].strip()

with open('Pride and Prejudice.txt', 'r') as myfile:
    pap_data = myfile.read().split('PRIDE AND PREJUDICE\n\nBy Jane Austen')[1].split('End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen')[0].strip()
```

Next, I decoded the text, and made some substitutions
using the [re library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html), like replacing double hyphens, which Austen sometimes uses
when a new speaker starts talking, with a space, and some odd quotation marks with their regular counterparts.

Additionally, the Project Gutenberg versions of both **Sense and Sensibility** and **Emma** are split by volume, 
which I decided to ignore, handling chapters only.
```python
# SaS unicode parsing
sas_data = re.sub('(--)|(_)', ' ', sas_data)
sas_data = unicode(re.sub(r"\s+", " ", sas_data), 'utf-8')
sas_data = re.sub(u"(\u201c|\u201d)", '"', sas_data)
sas_data = re.sub('VOLUME [IXV]+\s+', '', sas_data)

# Emma unicode parsing
emma_data = re.sub('--', ' ', emma_data)
emma_data = unicode(re.sub(r"\s+", " ", emma_data), 'utf-8')
emma_data = re.sub(u"(\u2018|\u2019)", "'", emma_data)
emma_data = re.sub(u"(\u201c|\u201d)", '"', emma_data)
emma_data = re.sub('VOLUME [IXV]+\s+', '', emma_data)

# PaP unicode parsing
pap_data = unicode(re.sub(r"\s+", " ", pap_data), 'utf-8')
pap_data = re.sub(u"(\u2018|\u2019)", "'", pap_data)
pap_data = re.sub(u"(\u201c|\u201d)", '"', pap_data)
```

# Vocabulary Comparison
In order to compare the words Austen uses in each novel, I first needed to clean the text a little
and find the unique words in each novel.

```python
def get_word_set(text):
    word_set = {word.lower() for word in re.sub(r"[^\w\s']+", ' ', text).split()}
    word_set.discard('')
    return word_set

# make each long string into a set of unique words
sas_set = get_word_set(sas_data)
emma_set = get_word_set(emma_data)
pap_set = get_word_set(pap_data)
```
This function returns a set of unique, lower-case words (as found after splitting on whitespace/punctuation).

Doing a quick comparison of unique words per novel versus words per novel, we see that **Emma**
has the most of both category, though the majority of this length must be coming from overlapping words,
since **Pride and Prejudice** has 75% the number of words that **Emma** does, but 88% the number of unique words.
<img src="/assets/img/Jane Austen/word_counts.PNG" />

To contrast the vocabularies, I next wanted a venn diagram to illustrate each book's vocabulary in relation to the others.
Rather than writing out each intersection expression to find each section of the venn diagram, 
I used [matplotlib-venn](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/matplotlib-venn), 
a small package with functions for plotting area-proportional two- and three-way Venn diagrams 
in matplotlib.

```python
# plot a venn diagram of overlapping vocabularies
from matplotlib_venn import venn3
venn3([sas_set, pap_set, emma_set], ('Sense and Sensibility', 'Pride and Prejudice', 'Emma'))
plt.show()
```
This conveniently provided a Venn diagram, with each segment labeled. 
However, I'm addicted to [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) and wanted all my plots to look
similar, so I used the numbers to generate a more visually pleasing venn diagram.

<img src="/assets/img/Jane Austen/venn.PNG" style="width: 550px;"/>

Interestingly, a higher proportion of the unique words Austen used in **Emma** are also unique to that specific novel,
as the 2,147 truly unique words in **Emma** comprise almost 30% of the 7,275 unique words used in **Emma**, while
both **Pride and Prejudice** and **Sense and Sensibility** have lower ratios, both around 21%.

# Word Frequencies
Next, I wanted to find word frequencies, but first needed to remove stopwords so my top words weren't all
words like *to*, *the*, *of*, and *her*...

```python
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
cachedStopWords = stopwords.words("english")+char_names_list

def tag_text(message):
    return nltk.pos_tag([word for word in re.findall(r"[a-z']+", message.lower()) 
			 if word not in cachedStopWords])

sas_words = pd.DataFrame(tag_text(sas_data), columns=['word', 'pos'])
emma_words = pd.DataFrame(tag_text(emma_data), columns=['word', 'pos'])
pap_words = pd.DataFrame(tag_text(pap_data), columns=['word', 'pos'])
```
I used the english stopwords from nltk, supplemented with character names from each novel.

The part of speech tagger from nltk is a little too granular for my goals, so I combined the labels I was interested
in and disposed of others (like punctuation), using the following:
```python
def condense_pos(df):
    df.loc[df['pos'].isin(['JJS', 'JJR']), 'pos'] = 'JJ'
    df.loc[df['pos'].isin(['NNP', 'NNPS', 'NNS']), 'pos'] = 'NN'
    df.loc[df['pos'].isin(['RBR', 'RBS']), 'pos'] = 'RB'
    df.loc[df['pos'].isin(['VBD' 'VBG', 'VBN', 'VBP', 'VBZ']), 'pos'] = 'VB'
    return df.loc[df['pos'].isin(['JJ', 'NN', 'RB', 'VB'])]
```

After condensing the parts of speech, I grouped each dataframe by part of speech and found the 5 most common
words for each novel/part of speech combination.

||Emma|Pride and<br>Prejudice|Sense and<br>Sensibility|
|:----|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|Adjectives|good<br>little<br>much<br>great<br>young|much<br>good<br>little<br>great<br>young<br>|much<br>good<br>little<br>great<br>young|
|Nouns|thing<br>time<br>nothing<br>man<br>day|time<br>nothing<br>**family**<br>room<br>man<br>|time<br>nothing<br>thing<br>**sister**<br>house|
|Adverbs|well<br>never<br>**quite**<br>always<br>soon|well<br>never<br>soon<br>however<br>ever<br>|well<br>never<br>soon<br>ever<br>however|
|Verbs|think<br>say<br>know<br>see<br>done|know<br>think<br>say<br>make<br>**go**<br>|think<br>know<br>say<br>see<br>make|

Clearly, Austen uses most of the same words frequently in each of her novels. A few standouts 
include:
* **family, Pride and Prejudice**: Elizabeth, the protagonist, spends the majority of the book embarrassed by her family or dealing with the fallout of their foolish actions. Almost every major plot development is instigated by one of the Bennet family.
* **sister, Sense and Sensibility**: Rather obvious, as the book centers around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne (representing sense and sensibility, respectively).
* **go, Pride and Prejudice**: Much more so than the other novels, Pride and Prejudice centers around trips, with comings-and-goings to London, Brighton, etc.

# "Do they do anything except talk?"
One common complaint against **Emma** is that nothing ever happens, as the majority of the book
is devoted to petty squabbles with little actual action or travel.
While this is a highly subjective question, 
I hypothesized that **Emma** has proportionally more time devoted to conversations 
than the other novels.

To demonstrate this, I investigated how  much of each book is conversations, which I decided to measure
as the ratio of words quoted to total words used.

To extract this ratio, I first needed to ensure that all quotes were separated with a `"` symbol.
This required differentiating between `'` in different uses, such as:
1. `'No, my dear, you had better go on horseback...' Mrs. Bennet declared...`
2. `Mr. Bingley's sister...`

<br>
I accomplished this with a regular expression that incorporates a forwards and backwards lookup. 
If the apostrophe appears between two word characters (as in `don't`), it should not be replaced.
Hence, the apostrophe must either have a non-word character before it, or a non-word character after it.
Otherwise, it is a single quotation mark, which I replaced with a double quotation mark using `re.sub`

I then found all sections surrounded by double quotation marks using `re.findall`, and found the number
of words in such sections compared to the number of words in the entire novel, as follows:
```python
def find_conv_ratio(text):
	text = re.sub(r"((?<=[^\w])\'|\'(?=[^\w]))", '"', text)
	conv_list = ' '.join(re.findall(r'\"[^\"]+\"', text)).split()
	all_list = text.split()
	return len(conv_list)/float(len(all_list))
```
Applying this function, I found the following:

|Emma| 49.6%|
|Pride and Prejudice | 51.9%|
|Sense and Sensibility | 45.2%|

I was wrong! **Emma** actually has a lower percentage of words devoted to conversations than **Pride and
Prejudice**. Of course, you can still find Emma boring, but you can't blame that on all the talking.

# Story Highs and Lows
I next wanted to see if there was a way to extract the flow of the story, using text analysis.

Unsure how to ask a computer to read a book, I decided the closest I could get was a sentiment analysis.
I turned once again to VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) (a Python [package](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) 
developed to extract sentiment from blocks of text), which I used in my [Edmunds reviews analysis]({{site.url}}/2017/11/16/edmunds-reviews/).

I used the `compound` score (ranges from -1 to 1), defined as:
1. **Positive sentiment**: compound score >= 0.5
2. **Neutral sentiment**:  -0.5 < compound score < 0.5)
3. **Negative sentiment**: compound score <= -0.5

<br>
I decided to take a rolling average by 100 sentences, as this struck a good balance between reducing noise
and retaining overarching patterns. Using `np.convolve`:
```python
from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
analyser = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

conv = np.convolve([analyser.polarity_scores(s)['compound'] for s in 
			nltk.sent_tokenize(text)],
	np.ones((100,))/100,
	mode='valid')
```

I also split the raw text into chapter segments, and applied `nltk.sent_tokenize` to 
find the number of sentences per chapter (to apropriately label the X axis):
```python
df = pd.DataFrame(columns=['chapter', 'text'])
for index, chapter in enumerate(re.findall('CHAPTER [IVX]+', text)):
    df = df.append(pd.Series(['Chapter {}'.format(index+1), chunks[index].strip()],
                             index=['chapter', 'text']), ignore_index=True)

def num_sentences(group):
    return len(nltk.sent_tokenize(group))

#find number of sentences per chapter
df['sentences'] = df['text'].apply(num_sentences)
```
Using my knowledge of each novel's plot, I also added some annotations for major plot developments.

First, **Emma**:
<iframe src="/assets/img/Jane Austen/emma.html"
    sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
    width="100%"
    height="450"
    scrolling="no"
    seamless="seamless"
    frameborder="0">
</iframe>
Most of it looks like noise, except for a few outliers, like Chapter 47, when **Emma** finds out that Frank and Jane are engaged,
and she has been wrong about everything for the entire novel as she tries to set up those around her.
The range is slight, with a maximum sentiment average of .347 and a minimum of -.062.


Second, **Pride and Prejudice**:
<iframe src="/assets/img/Jane Austen/pride_and_prejudice.html"
    sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
    width="100%"
    height="450"
    scrolling="no"
    seamless="seamless"
    frameborder="0">
</iframe>
Here we can see much clearer highs and lows of the novel, closely correlated with major plot occurrences. 
Most noticeable is the gradual build over the final 3 chapters, leading up to the conclusion 
(Jane marries Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth marries Mr. Darcy).
The range is slightly smaller than that of Emma, with a higher high of .361 average sentiment, and a higher low of -.027.
More relevant to note, the standard deviation in rolling sentiment for Pride and Prejudice is 20% larger
than that of **Emma**, implying **Emma** has, on average, a more even tone, while **Pride and Prejudice** has
more emotional peaks and valleys.

Finally, **Sense and Sensibility**:
<iframe src="/assets/img/Jane Austen/sense_and_sensibility.html"
    sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
    width="100%"
    height="450"
    scrolling="no"
    seamless="seamless"
    frameborder="0">
</iframe>
Like **Pride and Prejudice**, the novel displays very clear highs and lows following the plot,
such as the deep low when Willoughby's engagement is discovered by Marianne.
Also note that the range of sentiment here is the widest of all novels, 
with a high of .433 and a low of -.054. 

Indeed, **Sense and Sensibility**'s standard deviation in rolling 
average sentiment is 32% larger than that of **Emma** and 14% larger than that of **Pride and Prejudice**,
implying it is the most tumultuous of the novels. This may be due to Marianne, a prominent supporting character
whose emotions (both positive and negative) run very strong.

# Character Appearances
I was also interested in tracking character mentions over the course of the book, and applied a similar
approach to find which chapters focused on which characters.

I decided to measure this by counting the number of sentences a character's name was used in each chapter, 
and then normalizing to find the percentage character mentions by chapter. 
For smoothness I again used `np.convolve`, taking a rolling average by 3 chapters.

I chose the characters for each novel, trying to pick the 8 characters I found most important to each story.

To deal with multiple names corresponding to the same character, I used lists of different names that
could refer to the same person, trying to be as specific as possible to avoid bleed between relatives.

For example, for **Pride and Prejudice**:
```python
def count_occurrences(sent_list, char_list):
    count = 0
    for sentence in sent_list:
        for name in char_list:
            if name in sentence:
                count+=1
                break
    return count

pap_chars = [['Elizabeth Bennet', 'Elizabeth', 'Lizzie'],
             ['Jane Bennet', 'Jane', 'Ms. Bennet'],
             ['George Wickham', 'Wickham'],
             ['Mr. Darcy', 'Darcy'],
             ['Mr. Bingley', 'Bingley'],
             ['Charlotte Lucas', 'Charlotte', 'Ms. Lucas', 'Mrs. Collins'],
             ['Lady Catherine', 'De Bourgh'],
             ['Mr. Collins', 'Collins']]

for char_list in pap_chars:
    # find occurrences by chapter for character
    pap_df[char_list[0]] = pap_df['text'].apply(count_occurrences, char_list=char_list)
    # normalize across chapters for percentage
    pap_df[char_list[0]] = pap_df[char_list[0]]/sum(pap_df[char_list[0]])
    # use np.convolve to take rolling average by 3 chapters
    pap_df[char_list[0]] = np.convolve(pap_df[char_list[0]].values, np.ones((3,))/3, mode='same')
```

First, for **Emma**:
<iframe src="/assets/img/Jane Austen/emma_char_density.html"
    sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
    width="100%"
    height="350"
    scrolling="no"
    seamless="seamless"
    frameborder="0">
</iframe>
(Note that the legend is interactive, click to hide/show the corresponding line).

We can see Emma herself is rather constantly mentioned, while more minor characters such as Jane Fairfax and Miss Bates
have more prominent spikes as their plot points develop.

Second, for **Pride and Prejudice**:
<iframe src="/assets/img/Jane Austen/pap_char_density.html"
    sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
    width="100%"
    height="350"
    scrolling="no"
    seamless="seamless"
    frameborder="0">
</iframe>
We can once again see spikes with relevant plot points, such as Lady Catherine, Charlotte, and Mr. Collins'
mutual spike around chapter 27-30, which detail Elizabeth's visit to Hunsford. Additionally, Lady Catherine
spikes again around chapter 56, when she confronts Elizabeth with her suspicions about Elizabeth and Darcy's
relationship. 

Lastly, for **Sense and Sensibility**:
<iframe src="/assets/img/Jane Austen/sas_char_density.html"
    sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
    width="100%"
    height="350"
    scrolling="no"
    seamless="seamless"
    frameborder="0">
</iframe>
Unlike the other two novels, we can see two characters who appear midway through the story, with Miss Grey
and Lucy Steele showing up around chapters 19 and 26, respectively. Indeed, Miss Grey's mentions are so concentrated
that almost 70% of her mentions occur in chapter 30, as you can see as her line disappears into the stratosphere.

The rest of the characters have rather constant mentions, probably due to no characters embarking on trips
in **Sense and Sensibility**, the way they do in **Pride and Prejudice** and **Emma**.

# Character Networks
I saw a lot of co-spikes in the previous section, such as the correlation between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley
in **Pride and Prejudice**, and the correlation between Elinor and Marianne Dashwood in **Sense and Sensibility**.
My last task was to map the relationship between various characters.

I decided to measure this by defining a *viewpoint* character, and measuring relationships between this character
and a *target* character by finding all sentences which mention the *viewpoint* character.
I also extracted the 3 sentences before and the 3 sentences after this sentence, and 
found the percentage of these segments which mention the *target* character.

```python
def get_occurrences_by_3(data, name_list):
	'''
	Finds blocks of 7 sentences, where the 4th sentence mentions the character in the name_list.
	'''
    sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(data)
    for index,sentence in enumerate(sentences):
        for name in name_list:
            if name in sentence or name.upper() in sentence:
                try:
                    output.append(" ".join(
		[sentences[i] for i in range(max(0,index-3), min(index+3, len(sentences)-1))]
				))
                except:
                    output = [" ".join(
		[sentences[i] for i in range(max(0,index-3), min(index+3, len(sentences)-1))]
				)]
                break
    return output

def get_relationship_float(data, viewpoint_list, target_list):
	'''
	Finds the percentage of sentences in 'data' which mention the 'viewpoint' character
	and also mention the 'target' character.
	'''
    subset = get_occurrences_by_3(data, viewpoint_list)
    for sentences in subset:
        for name in target_list:
            if name in sentences or name.upper() in sentences:
                try:
                    output.append(1)
                except:
                    output = [1]
                break
    try:
        return len(output)/float(len(subset))
    except:
        return 0.
```
Using `permutations` from the [itertools](https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html) library,
I found all combinations of *target* and *viewpoint* characters, and applied the above functions to 
find the strength of their relationship. For example, for **Emma**:
```python
emma_chars = [['Emma Woodhouse', 'Emma'], 
             ['Mr. Knightley', 'Knightley'],
             ['Frank Churchill', 'Frank', 'Mr. Churchill'],
             ['Jane Fairfax', 'Jane'],
             ['Harriet Smith', 'Harriet'], 
             ['Miss Bates', 'Bates'],
             ['Mrs. Weston', 'Taylor'],
             ['Mr. Elton', 'Elton']]
			 
relation_df = pd.DataFrame()
for viewpoint, target in list(itertools.permutations(emma_chars, 2)):
    relation_df = relation_df.append(
	pd.Series([viewpoint[0], target[0], get_relationship_float(emma_data, viewpoint, target)], 
		  index=['viewpoint', 'target', 'score']), 
	ignore_index=True)

```
Plugging these into a clock-style visualization, first for **Emma**:
<iframe src="/assets/img/Jane Austen/emma_char_network.html"
    sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
    width="100%"
    height="500"
    scrolling="no"
    seamless="seamless"
    frameborder="0">
</iframe>
We can see **Emma**, the protagonist, has the most evenly distributed co-occurrences across all other characters.
Every other character has the highest co-occurrence with **Emma**, but (rather interestingly) the final
matches can not be perceived based on co-occurrence. Frank Churchill, who ultimately marries Jane Fairfax,
has the same relationship similarity with her as he does with Harriet Smith. For her part, Jane has a greater
relationship with both Mr. Knightley and Mr. Elton than she does with her fiancee, Frank. 

Second, for **Pride and Prejudice**:
<iframe src="/assets/img/Jane Austen/pap_char_network.html"
    sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
    width="100%"
    height="500"
    scrolling="no"
    seamless="seamless"
    frameborder="0">
</iframe>
Here we can see two segments of characters: the first Elizabeth, Jane, Mr. Bingley, and Mr. Darcy, 
and the second Lady Catherine, Mr. Collins, and Charlotte Lucas. Wickham, something of a dramatic plot point
personified, has close ties with Elizabeth, who he courts, and Mr. Darcy, who is both a childhood friend
and present rival. Interestingly Charlotte bucks the trend of all supporting characters
being most connected to the protagonist, having a stronger relationship with Mr. Collins than
she does with the protagonist, Elizabeth.

Lastly, for **Sense and Sensibility**:
<iframe src="/assets/img/Jane Austen/sas_char_network.html"
    sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
    width="100%"
    height="500"
    scrolling="no"
    seamless="seamless"
    frameborder="0">
</iframe>
Miss Grey, like Charlotte from **Pride and Prejudice**, is an exception to the rule as she is most 
strongly linked to Willoughby, not Elinor. We can also see the strong link between the Dashwood sisters,
as both Elinor and Marianne are almost uniformly the strongest two connections any other character has,
probably due to their own shockingly high co-occurrence score (Elinor appears in 77% of Marianne's mentions!).

# Conclusion
How can you choose a winner? Emma has the largest vocabulary, but Pride and Prejudice the most complicated
character networks. Sense and Sensibility is certainly the most emotional read, with hyper-dramatic
characters. 

Despite all the measuring, poking, and prodding at the text I did, I leave it up to the reader
to select their favorite, hopefully after reading the novels rather than just analyzing them.

But for myself, Pride and Prejudice will always remain the favorite.

# Code
All analysis was completed using Python 2.7, relying primarily on the pandas, re, nltk, and Bokeh libraries. 
All code can be found in my Example Projects git [repository](https://github.com/p-mckenzie/example-projects).
